experiment
    /corpora        this directory contains text files used at the very beginning to train 
                    word vectors with word2vec
        test.txt    text should be tokenized, without tags, markup and puctuation
                    Example: "We went to see this performance It was very exciting"
                    Use short file name: by default they'll be used as prefix (=model identification) 
                    for all files later produced by the pipeline.
    /word2vec_c     (not commited)
                    Modified implementation of word2vec program. Saves context vector model
                    in addition to word vector model
                    TODO: add links to github
    /model          This directory is used to save vector models (word vectors, context vectors, sense vectors)
                    By default the naming follows following styling:
        <name>_word_vectors.bin     word vectors
        <name>_context_vectors.bin  context vectors
        <name>_sense_vectors.bin    sense vectors
                    (e.g. skip/cbow standing for skip-gram model or bag of words training approach of word2vec)
    /intermediate   This directory is used to store intermediate output of pipline steps
                    By default the naming follows following styling:
        <name>_neighbours.txt        output of word_neighbours.py
                                                    Nearest neighbours of every word
                                                    in word vector model identified by
                                                    <corpus name>_<param> in the DT format:
                                                    word1<TAB>neighbour1<TAB>similarity
                                                    ...
                                                    word1<TAB>neighbourN<TAB>similarity
                                                    word2<TAB>neighbour1<TAB>similarity
                                                    ...
    word_neighbours.py  Collect nearest words for every item in the word vector model
                        By default saves output to intermediate folder in <name>_neighbours.txt
    Journal.xml     Statistics of experiments. 
                    All parameters used for training, CPU time and other data.
    pipeline.py     Executes all steps of the pipline starting from word vector model
