### Number of clusters in JoBim wiki file
**Goal:** number of clusters in wiki JoBim clusters file 

**Command:**

```
iparker1$ wc -l dt-wiki-deps-jst-wpf1k-fpw1k-thr.csv-cw-e0-N200-n200-minsize15.csv
```

**Output:**

```
  930409 dt-wiki-deps-jst-wpf1k-fpw1k-thr.csv-cw-e0-N200-n200-minsize15.csv
```

**Observation:** 930409 - 1 clusters because first line is a header.

### Hands-on analysis of JoBim wiki
**Goal:**

* Inspect cluster for words ruby, python, Ruby, Python, tree (TWSI plant/structure), accident (TWSI tragedy/unexpected), pilot (TWSI trial/aviator)

**Expectation:**
Clusters not worse than ukwac clusters.

**Observations:**

* ruby: gem/color/smth strange (*with:0.018,out:0.018,like:0.018,on:0.017*)
* Ruby: name/language
* python: snake
* Python: Snake(capitalized animals)/language
* tree: plant (only one sense!)
* accident: disaster (only one sense!)
* pilot: fly(verbs)/aviator

For "tree" and "accident" wiki clusters is the same as ukwac. But for pilot it is worse. Ukwac has senses "trial", "aviator" and some mixed "aircraft/plane".


### Parse errors in wiki JoBim clusters 
**Goal:** Check for csv parsing errors of the clusters file in pooling.py. Decide whether to throw away wrong clusters completely or only words in those clusters

**Expectation:** Some words may contain commas or colon, which are used in DT format as separators. This will cause problems.

**Call:** See notebook intermediate/wiki-clusters_parse_errors

**Observation:**

* Definitely don't skip whole clusters, many problems are simply like this: 
 
	acyl-coa:0.003,dihydrofolate:0.003,a,c-diamide:0.003
	
* Mostly appear in cluster of words that are garbage (me., 10-4, st.), but sometimes not (heraldry, one-half, became)

### Pooling of sense vectors from wiki JoBim clusters (mean method) for wiki word vectors
**Expectation:** 

* Due to parse errors and some words not appearing in the word vector model, some clusters may loose items and get smaller than 5. These will be left out. Check that they do not contain important words and senses. 
* Cluster centre and cluster words are not lowercased

**Call:**

```
script wikijb_poolmean.log

time ./pooling.py intermediate/wiki-clusters-dep-cw-e0-N200-n200-minsize15-count930408.csv 930408 model/wiki-sz300-w3-cb1-it3-min20.w2v model/wiki-sz300-w3-cb1-it3-min20.w2v.senses.mean -inventory intermediate/wiki-clusters_inventory_mean.csv
```

**Output:** see intermediate/wikijb_poolmean.log

**Observations:**

* all deleted clusters are unimportant garbage.
* only 0.5% deleted (it makes sense, because original clusters had at least 15 items and we prune them by minsize 5)
* results in 925104 senses
* letter case is correct
* 11 minutes

### Pooling of sense vectors from wiki JoBim clusters (weighted method) for wiki word vectors
**Expectation:** 

No statistical changes if compared to mean pooling: same number of senses, of small clusters, identical inventory

**Call:**

```
script wikijb_poolweighted.log

time ./pooling.py intermediate/wiki-clusters-dep-cw-e0-N200-n200-minsize15-count930408.csv 930408 model/wiki-sz300-w3-cb1-it3-min20.w2v model/wiki-sz300-w3-cb1-it3-min20.w2v.senses.weighted -inventory intermediate/wiki-clusters_inventory_weighted.csv
```

**Observations:**

* Also results in 925104 senses.
* 11,5 minutes
* Identical inventories (judged by file size)

**Note:** leave only one inventory named ```wiki-clusters_inventory.csv```
